## Hello! 🐧

I'm Danh, a Mechanical Engineering Cal Poly Pomona Student aspiring to be Robotics Engineer.

I am currently a Control Systems Engineer Intern: designing, modeling, and fabricating a 5-fingered manipulator robotic arm.

If I think or see something cool, chances are I will build it.

I love combining software, electrical, and mechanical aspects to create a tangible project I can interact with every day.

My main tools are SolidWorks CAD, PCB Designer Altium, and VS Code. My main languages are C++, Python, and MATLAB.

I started making projects in 2025, and they are listed in my [LinkedIn](https://danhtran.org/)!

Feel free to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danhctran/)!

Fun Facts:
• I want cats (please)
• Coffee wakes me up by making me shit myself
• I think about how to build IRL things in Minecraft
• Hobbies: gaming, hiking, building
